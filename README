Hello!!  Welcome to bub.ly!  Here you can upload files and shorten links. You can even use a (applescript) droplet on your dock to upload files easily. 

The site consists of two main pages: a homepage with a login/sign up form, and an account page that you see once you are logged in. The account page lists all the links you have shortened and all the files you have uploaded. The account page also provides you with an area to upload files, a download link for your personalized applescript droplet, and a draggable bookmarklet to shorten links.

USING DROPLET TO UPLOAD FILES

For Optional Amazon S3 Hosting for files:
RUNNING pyres message queue:
 - INSTALLATION
 
    $ sudo pip install boto==1.9b pyres==0.9 itty==0.6.4 pystache==0.2.0 redis==2.0.0
    
    Note:  Installing pyres may revert the redis to 1.34 version. We need
           2.0.0 since we use redis hashes

 - There is no need to run pyres to the project working. But it will used to 
   upload the files to S3 asynchronously to reduce the server costs. Similarly
   there is a job to delete the file from S3 when the entry is killed by user.
 
  $ pyres_worker fileupload filedelete
