Droplet is a apple script which uploads the file dragged on the application 
icon. The apple script runs a CURL posting the file data to the URL endpoint.
Along with the file an API key is also passed to identify the user who 
uploaded it. The api key is saved in the file ~/.bubly.

  $ echo  xxxxxxx > ~/.bubly
